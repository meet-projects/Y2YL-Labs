# React Native Workshop - A Taste of Mobile Development


## Objective: 
In this mini project, you will get to experience the basic building blocks of mobile development.<br><br>
By doing this using React Native, you will gain an understanding of how apps like Facebook, Instagram, Discord, Skype, Pinterest and more are built.

Before you go ahead, how would you like to see the app you will be building on your own phone, live? <br>If so, head up to the AppStore or PlayStore and install `Expo Client`. (Alternatively, you can see the results in real time in the `Expo Snack` on your laptop just as we did in the demo!)

So what are you waiting for? **Create your first mobile application!**
<br>

## Instructions:
This will be the starting point - 
1. Open this [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.io/@julianbroudy/a-taste-of-react-native) - Starting with a simple empty template/project, ready to be manipulated.
    - You might need to sign up/log in in order to save your work.
1. Add a **Button** component that takes you from `screen1` to `screen2`.
    - Check out [Button Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/handling-touches) by React Native.
1. Add a List of your family members/friends names on `screen2`.
    - You can use the following components: [FlatList](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist), [ListView](https://reactnative.dev/docs/using-a-listview), [ListItem](https://reactnativeelements.com/docs/listitem/)..etc.
1. Make each element (family member/friends names) **pressable** 
    - When pressed - show an alert. (Hint: Find out how to create alerts [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/alert))
