# Image Recognition 

## What is this? 
Image recognition, in the context of machine vision, is the ability of software to identify objects, places, people, writing and actions in images.


## Where is this used?
Here’s an introduction article about understanding [image recognition and its uses](https://www.einfochips.com/blog/understanding-image-recognition-and-its-uses/).

### Hints:
- Make sure to set the best [optimizer](https://keras.io/api/optimizers/) that suits your project/use.
- Don’t set the epochs too high (It will take too much time and there’s a very high chance that your hard disk will burn :D )
- Don’t forget to write a line of code at the end that saves the model!!


## Hypothetical projects you could do!
- Create an app that detects what's inside the images.
- Create a login using face detection.
